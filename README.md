# A Personal Photo Gallery for Windows
This is a personal project to get more familiar with C# and Windows app development using WPF - 
it's in no way done.

Currently, you can see the entire gallery at once, or scroll through images individually.
You can add tags to images and filter the gallery view by tag. In the future, I want to add more flexible views based on date, location, or event.
